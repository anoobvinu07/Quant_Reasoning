abstract = {Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of the response to selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions. Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioral traits, have inherently nonnormal distributions. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for nonnormal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically convenient latent scale, it is often desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are measured. The parameters of fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal with this by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulas for quantities such as heritability of traits with binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population.},

abstract = {Non-bifurcating divergence caused by introgressive hybridization is continuously reported for groups of closely related species. In this study, we aimed to construct genome-scale classification of deep lineages of the conifer genus Picea, establish their phylogenetic relationships and test the bifurcating hypothesis between deeply branching lineages based on genomic data. We sequenced the transcriptomes of 35 individuals of 27 taxa covering all main lineages of the genus. Four major lineages, comprising three to 12 taxa each, largely consistent with morphological evidence, were recovered across the coalescent and integrated nuclear phylogeny. However, many of the individual gene trees recovered contradict one another. Moreover, the well-supported coalescent tree here inferred differs from previous studies based on various DNA markers, with respect to topology and inter-lineage relationships. We identified the shared polymorphisms between four major lineages. ABBA-BABA tests confirmed the inter-lineage gene flow and thus violated the bifurcating divergence model. Gene flow occurred more frequently between lineages distributed in the same continent than those disjunct between continents. Our results indicate that introgression and non-bifurcating diversification apply, even between deeply branching lineages of the conifer genus Picea. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Human assisted movement of reforestation stock poleward or upward in elevation has been proposed as a tool to address climate change in regular reforestation programs. However, moving warm adapted seed sources to colder environments could carry the risk of frost damage if seed sources are moved too far. Here, we assess genetic differentiation in growth potential, survival and cold hardiness of a wide-ranging tree species, white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss). We use data from a 34-year-old common garden experiment planted in the approximate center of the species range. Cold hardiness was negatively related to growth and positively to survival. Generalized additive models identified mean coldest month temperature and latitude (as a proxy for the day length regime) as an exceptionally good predictor for the onset of cold hardiness (R 2 adj = 0.91). The results suggest that day length, an environmental factor that is not influenced by climate change, is an important factor controlling the timing of the onset of hardiness. Survival was only moderately well predicted, primarily by precipitation of the provenance origin (R 2 adj = 0.36) indicating that other adaptive traits besides cold hardiness should be considered in assisted migration prescriptions. Survival of seed sources appears primarily compromised when transplanting sources from wet origins to a dry location. Nevertheless, acceptable migration distances without significant tradeoffs were up to 500 km north and 1500 km west towards a central planting location.},

@article{Bontrager2018,
abstract = {Populations at the margins of a species{\&}{\#}039; geographic range are often thought to be poorly adapted to their environment. According to theoretical predictions, gene flow can inhibit these range edge populations if it disrupts adaptation to local conditions. Alternatively, if range edge populations are small or isolated, gene flow can provide beneficial genetic variation, and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change. We tested these competing predictions in the annual wildflower Clarkia pulchella using greenhouse crosses to simulate gene flow from sources across the geographic range into two populations at the northern range margin. We planted these between-population hybrids in common gardens at the range edge, and evaluated how genetic differentiation and climatic differences between edge populations and gene flow sources affected lifetime fitness. During an anomalously warm study year, gene flow from populations occupying historically warm sites improved fitness at the range edge, and plants with one or both parents from warm populations outperformed local plants. The effects of the temperature provenance of gene flow sources were most apparent at early life history stages, but precipitation provenance also affected reproduction. We also found benefits of gene flow that were independent of climate: after climate was controlled for, plants with parents from different populations performed better at later lifestages than those with parents from the same population, indicating that gene flow may improve fitness via relieving homozygosity. Further supporting this result, we found that increasing genetic differentiation of parental populations had positive effects on fitness of hybrid seeds. Gene flow from warmer populations, when it occurs, is likely to contribute adaptive genetic variation to populations at the northern range edge as the climate warms. On heterogeneous landscapes, climate of origin may be a better predictor of gene flow effects than geographic origin.},
