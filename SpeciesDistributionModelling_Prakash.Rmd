##Step 1: Expected outcomes

By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:

Understand the concepts of Landscape ecology and Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) and how it fits within the broader framework of landscape ecology. 

**Topics to be covered:**  

- Patch-corridor-matrix  

- Scientific principles of landscape ecology  

    - Fragmentation  
    - Structure and Function  
    - Connectivity  
    - Individual focal species  
    - Generic focal species  
  
  
- Applications and themes  

    - SLOSS tradeoffs  
    - Corridor linkage  
    - Inter-disciplinary studies  
  

- Species Distribution Modelling  

    - Cuurent trends  
    
        - $\Delta$TraitSDM  

##Step 2: Assessing outcomes

Students will be assessed through discussion.

##Step 3: Learning plan

  - New concepts regarding landscape ecology will be introduced and help them relate to the ones studied in the spatial ecology lectures.  
  - This might probably be review at this point of time for some. Try to understand the underlying concepts and the current trends in field.  
  - Learn why it evolved and how interdciplinary science and technological advances are helping it grow.
  - Try to answer some in-class questions and discuss various ideas within groups.
